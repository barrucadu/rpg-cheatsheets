\subsection{Significant Actions}

\textbf{Melee Attack}\\
\chrskillcheck{str {\normalfont or} dex}{Melee (specialism)}.

\textbf{Ranged Attack}\\
\chrskillcheck{dex}{Gun Combat (specialism)}.

\begin{tabularx}{\linewidth}{lX} \toprule
Bonus & \textsc{dm} \\ \midrule
Aiming & +1 per aim action (max +6) \\
Laser Sight & +1 if aiming \\
Short Range & +1 \\ \midrule
Penalty & \\ \midrule

\end{tabularx}

\textbf{Short range:} up to $\times\frac{1}{4}$.\\
\textbf{Long range:} up to $\times 2$.\\
\textbf{Extreme range:} up to $\times 4$, or 100m if no scope.

\textbf{Miscellaneous}\\
Skill check, or full concentration, or is complicated.\\
\textit{e.g.} applying first aid, bypassing a security system.

\subsection{Minor Actions}

\textbf{Aim}\\
\diemod{+1} on the immediately following ranged attack.

\textbf{Change Stance}\\
Crouch or lie prone.

\textbf{Draw / Reload}\\
Draw, make ready for combat, or reload (unless noted otherwise in the
weapon description).

\textbf{Move}\\
Move a number of metres up to Movement score (usually 6 for humans).
Difficult terrain halves speed.  Being prone quarters speed.

\textbf{Miscellaneous}\\
Doesn't require concentration, or is simple.\\
\textit{e.g.} identifying equipment, picking something up.

\subsection{Reactions}

Each reaction gives \diemod{-1} on the next turn.

\textbf{Dodge}\\
Inflict the highest of the \textsc{dex} or Athletics (dex) \textsc{dm}
as a penalty to the Attack roll.

\textbf{Dive for Cover (vs Ranged)}\\
Inflict \diemod{-2} and reach cover within 1.5 metres.  If no cover,
only \diemod{-1}.  This skips the next turn.

\textbf{Parry}\\
In close combat, inflict Melee \textsc{dm} as a penalty to the Attack
roll.

\textbf{Opportunity Attack}\\
Attack if a combatant leaves close combat with \diemod{+2} to the
Attack roll.

\subsection{Extended Actions}

Roll for duration in rounds.  When taking damage, make a check with
the damage taken as a negative \textsc{dm} to see if that round's
progress counts.

Exceptional Failure means all progress is lost.

\subsection{Damage}

Add the Effect of the Attack roll to weapon damage (unless
Destructive, in which case no Effect but $\times 10$).  Melee attacks
also add \textsc{str} \textsc{dm}.

Armour reduces damage.  Effect 6 on the Attack roll deals at least 1
damage.

\begin{tabularx}{\linewidth}{Xr} \toprule
Cover & Bonus Armour \\ \midrule
Vegetation & +2 \\
Trees & +6 \\
Stone Wall & +8 \\
Vehicle & +10 \\
Armoured Vehicle & +15 \\
Fortifications & +20 \\ \bottomrule
\end{tabularx}

\subsection{Grappling}

Opposed \chrskillcheck{str {\normalfont or} dex}{Melee (unarmed)}.

\textbf{The winner may do one of the following:}\\
Force prone.\\
Disarm and (if Effect 6+) take the weapon.\\
Throw \dice{1d} metres for \dice{1d} damage.\\
Inflict 2 + Effect damage, ignoring armour.\\
Attack with a pistol, blade, or other small weapon.\\
Drag up to 3 metres.

\subsection{Dual Wielding}

\diemod{-2} to Attack rolls with both.

\subsection{Leadership}

One Traveller may make a Leadership check.  Their side gets Boon or
Bane dice equal to the Effect.
\end{multicols}

\begin{multicols}{2}
\section{Damage}

Damage is taken from \textsc{end}, then from \textsc{str} or
\textsc{dex}.  When two characteristics reach 0, the Traveller falls
unconscious.  When three characteristics reach 0:

\begin{tabularx}{\linewidth}{lX} \toprule
\dice{2d + dm} & Result \\ \midrule
2 or less & Destroyed gruesomely. \\
2 to 3 & Killed outright. \\
4 to 5 & Die without prompt medical attention.  Gain a disability. \\
6 to 7 & Die without prompt medical attention.  Lose \dice{1d} from one of max \textsc{str}, \textsc{dex}, \textsc{end}, and \dice{d3} from the others. \\
8 to 9 & Survive if given even basic medical attention.  Lose \dice{d3} from \textsc{str} and \textsc{end} without good medical care during recovery. \\
10 to 11 & Survive without assistance and make a full recovery with care. \\
12 or more & Survive and make a full recovery even without assistance. \\ \bottomrule
\end{tabularx}

\textbf{Final attack caused less than 3 points of damage:} \diemod{+4}.\\
\textbf{Final attack caused 4 to 6 points of damage:} \diemod{+2}.\\
\textbf{Final attack caused more than 6 points of damage:} \diemod{-2}.\\
Luck can be \textbf{permanently} spent to gain a bonus.

\vfill\columnbreak
\section{Healing}
\textbf{First Aid}\\
Must be done within one minute of injury.  Recover \dice{Medic Effect}
points.

\textbf{Surgery}\\
Requires a sick bay or hospital, and three damaged physical
characteristics.  Recover \dice{3 + Medic Effect} points.

\textbf{Medical Care}\\
Requires a sick bay or hospital and bed rest, and less than three
damaged physical characteristics.  Recover \dice{3 + end dm + Medic
  Skill} points per day.

\textbf{Natural Healing}\\
Requires bed rest.  Recover \dice{1d + end dm} (just \textsc{end dm}
if in need of surgery).

\textbf{Augmentation and Medical Care}\\
If done in a lower-tier facility, Medic checks take the difference
between the \textsc{tl} of the highest relevant augmentation and the
facility as a negative \textsc{dm}.

\textbf{Unconsciousness}\\
Make an \textsc{end} check to regain consciousness, with a cumulative
\diemod{+1}.

\textbf{First Aid, Surgery:} spread recovered characteristic points as desired.\\
\textbf{Medical Care, Natural Healing:} spread recovered characteristic points evenly.
\end{multicols}

\section{Weapon Traits}

\begin{multicols}{3}
\subsection{AP $x$}

Ignores $x$ points of armour.

Spacecraft-scale targets ignore this trait unless the weapon making
the attack is also spacecraft-scale.

\subsection{Artillery}

Can fire normally at targets in line-of-sight or indirectly at targets
out of line-of-sight with \diemod{-2}.

If the precise location of the target is not known, the attack lands
\dice{1d} meters away for every 100 meters (rounded up) the target is
from the attacker, minus the Effect of the Attack roll.

\textbf{Forward observers}\\
An observer with direct line-of-sight to the target and a comms link
with the attacker may make an \chrskillcheck{int}{Electronics (comms)}
to start a task chain with the attacker.

In this case, if the attacker misses, roll \dice{1d} for each point of
negative Effect, and multiply the total by 10 (if an aircraft or
artillery weapon) or 100 (if an orbital weapon), and that is how many
metres away from the target the attack lands.

\subsection{Auto $x$}

Can be fired in one of three modes:

\textbf{Single}\\
As a normal ranged attack.

\textbf{Burst}\\
Add $x$ to the damage.  This uses $x$ rounds, and cannot benefit from
the Aim action or Scope trait.

\textbf{Full Auto}\\
Make $x$ attacks, which may be against multiple targets so long as all
are within 6 metres of each other.  This uses $3 \times x$ rounds and
cannot benefit from the Aim action or Scope trait.

\subsection{Blast $x$}

Damage is rolled against every target within $x$ metres.  Cannot be
dodged, but targets may dive for cover.

\subsection{Bulky}

Must have \textsc{str} 9 or higher to use without penalty.  Otherwise,
Attack rolls are made with \textsc{dm} equal to the difference between
the attacker's \textsc{str dm} and 1.

\subsection{Dangerous}

If the Attack roll has an Effect of -5 or less the weapon explodes,
rendering it inoperable, and the damage is inflicted upon the attacker
using it.

\subsection{Fire}

Sets the target on fire, dealing damage each round.  If the target is
set on fire multiple times, use the highest weapon fire damage.

\textbf{Extinguishing a fire}\\
Roll \dice{2d} at the start of every round.  On an 8 or more, the fire
burns out.  A Traveller may extinguish a fire as a Significant Action
with a \chrcheck{dex} (\diemod{+2} with firefighting equipment).

\subsection{One Use}

Rendered useless after a single use.

\subsection{Radiation}

A straight line of radiation extends from the attacker, through the
target, and out to a distance in metres equal to the number of damage
dice of the weapon (multiplied by 10 for Destructive weapons).

All targets caught in the radiation receive \dice{2d $\times$ 20}
rads, multiplied by 5 for spacecraft-scale weapons.

\subsection{Scope}

Ignores the rule that ranged attacks over 100 metres are considered to
be Extreme Range regardless of the weapon's range.

\subsection{Silent}

Any attempts to detect the sound of the weapon firing suffer
\diemod{-6}.

\subsection{Smart}

Attack rolls gain \textsc{dm} equal to the difference between the TL
of the weapon and the TL of the target, from a minimum of \diemod{+1}
to a maximum of \diemod{+6}.

\subsection{Smasher}

Cannot be parried.

\subsection{Stun}

Damage is only deducted from \textsc{end}, not from \textsc{str} or
\textsc{dex}.  If the target's \textsc{end} reaches zero, they are
incapacitated for a number of rounds equal to the number by which the
damage exceeded their \textsc{end}.

Damage from \textbf{Stun} weapons is completely healed by one hour of
rest.

\subsection{Very Bulky}

Like \textbf{Bulky}, but requires \textsc{str} 12 or higher and the
penalty is the difference from 2.

\subsection{Very Dangerous}

Like \textbf{Dangerous}, but explodes if the Effect of the Attack roll
is -3 or less.

\subsection{Zero-G}

Does not require an \skillcheck{Athletics (dex)} when fired in Zero-G.
\end{multicols}

\section{House Rules}

\begin{multicols*}{2}
\subsection{Healing}
An injured Traveller who does not seek medical treatment or bed rest
must, at the end of every day, roll \dice{1d + end dm}.

On -1 or lower, the Traveller loses that many characteristic points.

Furthermore, if the Traveller has a characteristic at 0 points, they
are too injured to do anything but rest.

\vfill\,\columnbreak

\subsection{Rumour Gathering}
Takes \dice{1d} hours and requires mixing with NPCs and making an
appropriate skill check.  For example:

\textbf{Attending a party}\\
\chrskillcheck{soc}{Carouse}, \dice{1d} hours

\textbf{Visiting a casino}\\
\chrskillcheck{int}{Gambler}, \dice{1d} hours

\textbf{Going on a pub crawl}\\
\chrskillcheck[Routine]{end}{Carouse}, \dice{4$\times$1d} hours
